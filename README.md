# Export Plus

A greatly improved export tool for your WordPress site.

The export tool built into WordPress limits how you can export your data by giving you a restrictive UI and very few options. This plugin fixes that by adding a new export page with more flexible options through the cunning use of checkboxes (instead of radio buttons). By using "Export Plus" you can easily export any selection of post types filtered by author, date and status across *all* of them, not just the built-in ones.

See the plugin `screenshot-1.png` for the differences that "Export Plus" provides.

I originally submitted this as a [patch](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27048) to WordPress Core, but it doesn't look like it's going to be added so I decided to release it as a plugin instead.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will this plugin's export file work with the WordPress importer?

Yes - the export file generated by this plugin is identical to the one generated by the built-in export tool, so it will work with the WordPress importer. The difference is that this plugin provides more options for how you export your data.

### Does this plugin replace the built-in export tool?

No - it adds a secondary export page that you can use instead of WordPress' built-in one. However, if you would like to hide the built-in export tool from the menu simply add this code to your theme's functions.php file:
```
add_filter('export_plus_hide_export', '__return_true');
```
